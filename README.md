A chess game written in Python with an AI that will play against you :)

## IMPORT FOR CHESS GAME TO WORK CORRECTLY.

1. For starters this program was written in Python 3.X.X. So that's important to be wary of.
1. To run this program the user will need to download the pygame and pygame-gui libraries.
1. This Chess game was created to be used on Macbooks. Unfortunately, I only have a Macbook meaning I don't know the exact requirements to make this program usable on 
non-macbooks. I believe the size of the board/pieces all need to be reduced. When I have time I will go to the library to see if I can use one of their Windows PCs to 
test what needs to be changed.
1. This program expects that the user, will have a directory/folder named "images" as well as a picture of all the pieces titled "piece.png". The "pieces.png" is 
locatable under an images file. Images is a name that may be already in place by the user for other reasons (depending on if they've made a directory titled that). If 
you want to store "pieces.png" under a different directory, be sure to specify the path to "pieces.png" on line 29 of the chess_gui.py as well as line 35 of 
piece_model.py.

I believe that's all the requirements/things to know. If there's any problems don't be afraid to do an issues or to contact me at alecmirambeau@gmail.com

Enjoy!
